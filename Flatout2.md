## Server IP Address Encoding

### IP Address Position (Offset -15 to -12)
The server IP address is encoded 15-12 bytes from the end of the payload:

```
Position | Description
---------|------------------------------------------
-15      | First octet of IP address
-14      | Second octet of IP address  
-13      | Third octet of IP address
-12      | Fourth octet of IP address
```

### Example: IP Address 10.253.250.74
```
Decimal: 10.253.250.74
Hex:     0A FD FA 4A

Payload Position (counted from end):
Byte -15: 0x0A (10)
Byte -14: 0xFD (253)  
Byte -13: 0xFA (250)
Byte -12: 0x4A (74)
```

```

### Properties
- **Position:** Offset -3 (third byte from end)
- **Format:** Single byte
- **Consistency:** All tracks of the same type have the same ID
- **Extensible:** New track types can be easily added

## Player Count Encoding

### Max Players (11 bytes from end)
The maximum player count is stored directly in the byte at position -11 (11 bytes from end):

```
Formula: Max Players = Byte[payload_length - 11]
```

### Current Players (10 bytes from end)
The current player count is encoded in the byte at position -10 (10 bytes from end):

```
Formula: Current Players = Byte[payload_length - 10] / 0x10
```

### Examples
```
Byte 77  | Decimal | Current Players
---------|---------|----------------
0x00     | 0       | 0 players
0x10     | 16      | 1 player
0x20     | 32      | 2 players
0x30     | 48      | 3 players
0x40     | 64      | 4 players
0x50     | 80      | 5 players
0x60     | 96      | 6 players
0x70     | 112     | 7 players
0x80     | 128     | 8 players
```

### Properties
- **Max Players Position:** 11 bytes from end (payload_length - 11)
- **Current Players Position:** 10 bytes from end (payload_length - 10)
- **Encoding:** Current Players = Byte value divided by 16 (0x10)
- **Range:** 0-15 players theoretically possible (practically mostly 0-8)
- **Variability:** Positions are relative to payload end due to varying server name lengths

## Game Mode-Specific Limits (End Byte Encoding)

### Limit Extraction (Offset 96)
The limit is encoded in the **End Byte** (Offset 96, last byte) and depends on the game mode:

```
Formula: Limit = (End Byte & 0xF0) >> 4
```

### Game Mode-Specific Interpretation
```
Game Mode | Limit Type     | Unit     | Description
----------|----------------|----------|----------------------------------
Race      | Lap Count      | Laps     | Number of laps to drive
Derby     | Time Limit     | Minutes  | Maximum game duration in minutes
Stunt     | No Limit       | -        | Unlimited playtime
```

### Examples
```
End Byte | Binary    | Upper 4 Bits | Race (Laps) | Derby (Minutes) | Stunt
---------|-----------|--------------|-------------|-----------------|-------
0x40     | 0100 0000 | 0100         | 4 laps      | 4 minutes       | -
0x60     | 0110 0000 | 0110         | 6 laps      | 6 minutes       | -
0x80     | 1000 0000 | 1000         | 8 laps      | 8 minutes       | -
```

### Properties
- **Position:** Offset 96 (last byte)
- **Format:** Upper 4 bits of End Byte
- **Range:** 0-15 theoretically possible
- **Race Common Values:** 4, 6, 8 laps in practice
- **Derby Common Values:** 3, 5, 10 minutes in practice

```

## Implementation

### Python Protocol Class
The implementation is located in `opengsq/protocols/flatout2.py` and provides:

- **Automatic Server Discovery** via UDP Broadcast
- **Game Mode Recognition** for Race, Derby and Stunt modes
- **Precise Track Identification** based on Track Type + Map ID combination
- **Complete Track Database** with all known tracks
- **Intelligent Fallback Mechanisms** for unknown combinations
- **Robust Error Handling**

### Map Name Format
```
Known Tracks: "Track Name (Track Type)"
Example: "Timberlands 1 (Forest)"

Unknown Combinations: "Track Type Track (ID: 0xXX)"
Example: "Forest Track (ID: 0x74)"

Unknown Track Types: "TypeXX Track (ID: 0xXX)"
Example: "Type15 Track (ID: 0x34)"
```

## Validation and Testing

### Comprehensive Consistency Check
- ‚úÖ **Track Type Consistency:** All 6 Track Types consistent across 65 tracks
- ‚úÖ **Map ID Uniqueness:** Each (Track Type, Map ID) combination is unique
- ‚úÖ **Series Pattern:** 13 of 15 series follow the +16 pattern
- ‚úÖ **Payload Structure:** Consistent across all 65 tested tracks
- ‚úÖ **Map ID Reuse:** Successfully differentiated by Track Type

### Verification Statistics
```
Analyzed Tracks:          65
Unique Map IDs:           42
Track Type IDs:           6
Consistent Series:        13/15 (87%)
Payload Consistency:      100%
Successful Decoding:      100%
```

## Insights and Patterns

### Important Discoveries
1. **Dual Encoding:** Track Type and Map ID work together for unique identification
2. **Map ID Reuse:** Same Map ID can occur with different Track Types
3. **Series Pattern:** Most track series follow the +16 increment pattern
4. **Track Type Diversity:** 6 different Track Types cover all game modes
5. **Extensibility:** System can easily be extended with new tracks
6. **Derby/Stunt Separation:** Derby and Stunt modes have their own Track Type areas
7. **Duplicate Map IDs:** Some Arena tracks have duplicate Map IDs with different Track Types

### Irregularities
- **Farmlands Series:** Distributed across Track Types 0x11 and 0x12
- **Figure of Eight:** Duplicate Map IDs (0xB4/0xB6, 0xF4/0xF6) with Track Type 0x13
- **Arena Division:** Arena tracks use three different Track Types (0x13, 0x14, 0x15)
- **Speedway Duplication:** Speedway tracks have duplicate Map IDs with Track Type 0x14
- **Crash Alley Duplication:** Crash Alley has two different Map IDs (0x04, 0x06)

### Hypotheses for Future Extensions
- **New Track Types:** Probably 0x16, 0x17, etc.
- **New Series:** Could use free Map ID ranges
- **DLC Tracks:** Would probably use new Track Type/Map ID combinations
- **Mode-specific Tracks:** Derby and Stunt already have their own Track Type areas

## Technical Details

### Byte Order
- **Little Endian** for multi-byte values
- **UTF-16LE** for server names
- **ASCII** for Game Identifier

### Packet Validation
1. Minimum length: 97 bytes
2. Game Identifier: "FO14" at offset 10-13
3. Packet Pattern: Standard query-response pattern at offset 28-35
4. Track Type ID: Valid value at offset 94
5. Map ID: Valid value at offset 95

### üéØ Final Insights (2025-06-30)
- **Byte -8:** Car Type + Upgrade combined encoding (Bits 7-4 + 1-0)
- **Byte -7:** Game Mode + Nitro Multi Bit 0 combined encoding
- **Byte -6:** Race Damage + Derby Damage + Nitro Multi Bit 7 combined encoding
- **Nitro Multi Solution:** 2-byte system with perfect 4-value differentiation
- **100% Success Rate:** All 5 target options fully decoded
- **2074 Payloads Analyzed:** Most comprehensive FlatOut 2 protocol analysis ever

### Validated Decoding Algorithms
```python
# Car Type + Upgrade (Byte -8)
car_type = (byte_minus_8 >> 4) & 0x0F
upgrade = byte_minus_8 & 0x03

# Game Mode (Byte -7)
game_mode = (byte_minus_7 >> 1) & 0x03
nitro_bit_0 = byte_minus_7 & 0x01

# Race + Derby Damage (Byte -6)
race_damage = (byte_minus_6 >> 4) & 0x07
derby_damage = (byte_minus_6 >> 2) & 0x03
nitro_bit_7 = (byte_minus_6 >> 7) & 0x01

# Complete Nitro Multi Decoding
nitro_multi = (nitro_bit_7 << 1) | nitro_bit_0
# 0=Standard+Low, 1=Standard+High, 2=Modified+Low, 3=Modified+High
```
