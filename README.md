# 🎮 Game Server Protocol Archive

Welcome to the **Game Server Protocol Archive** — an open collection of reverse-engineered network protocols used by various multiplayer game servers. Whether you're building server browsers, writing custom clients, creating monitoring tools, or simply exploring how games communicate over the network, this repository aims to provide the technical insights you need.

## 🧠 Purpose

This project documents and collects unofficial specifications of game server protocols. Many games rely on custom or undocumented protocols for server discovery, status queries, and client-server communication. Our goal is to make these protocols understandable, accessible, and reusable for developers, hobbyists, and the preservation community.

## 📚 Contents

Each protocol entry typically includes:

- ✅ **Protocol Overview**  
- 🌐 **Default Port(s)**  
- 🔁 **Query / Response Examples**  
- 🧩 **Packet Structures (Hex & JSON)**  
- ⚙️ **Implementation Notes**  
- 🛠️ **Sample Scripts or Tools (when available)**
-
